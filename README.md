# uk-counties-list

What you will find in this repository

* List of the United Kindom Counties (format: csv, 94 items)
* List of the main UK areas (format: csv, 12 items)
* Shapefiles ESRI (shp, shx, dbf, prj)
* KML files
* JavaScript Files (Google Maps API v3)

For almost each shapefile I have created a simplified version with semplified geometries (reduced by 30) using QGis. It reduces the precision but the file weight is much less.

Informations may be incorrect and incomplete, so please be sure to double check on the governament and authoritive websites before publishing any content on your website.
